# odin-recipies
Is anyone actually reading this? This is literally just code for a fake recipe website that I'm creating as part of The Odin Project's coding curriculum.
I'm genuinely not even sure how you found this repository.
In any case, I hope that this project will give me an opportunity to practice my skills in html.
*And also git commands. I'm going to have to use those a lot, and it'll be good to practice remembering which commands/flags to use and when.
