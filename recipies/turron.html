        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The Turron de Dona Pepa is an Afro-Peruvian dessert 
            closely associated with the feast of the Lord of Miracles 
            on October 28. It consists of layers of cookies and a fruit- 
            and spice-flavored caramel, topped with colorful sprinkles 
            and a prune or two. The caramel and cookies can be made 
            several days in advance and assembled later. </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        </ul>
        <p>For the cookies and assembly</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Anise seeds - 3 teaspoons</li>
            <li>All-purpose flour - 4.5 cups</li>
            <li>Kosher salt - 1 teaspoon</li>
            <li>Baking powder - 2 teaspoons</li>
            <li>Vegetable shortening - 2 cups</li>
            <li>Egg yolks - 5</li>
            <li>Granulated sugar - 1/4 cup</li>

            <li>Nonpareil sprinkles - as many as will fit on the turron</li>
            <li>Dried prunes - 1 to 2, for decoration</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <p>For the caramel:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Place everything in a pot and simmer over medium heat, 
                stirring to dissolve the sugars. Be careful not to mush up 
                the fruit too much. When the apples are fully cooked through 
                out to disintegrate, remove all the solids with a slotted spoon. 
                (It's okay if some small pieces are still in there.) Press the 
                solids through a sieve to remove any liquid or syrup and add it 
                back into the pot.
            </li>
            <li>
                Turn up the heat to medium-high heat until the syrup reaches 
                soft-ball stage (235 to 245 degrees Fahrenheit). To test 
                without a thermometer, drop some syrup into a small bowl of 
                ice water. If it clumps together into a ball of toffee-like 
                consistency, it is ready.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove the pot from the heat and let the caramel come down
                to room temperature.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>For the cookies and assembly:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Steep 1 teaspoon anise seeds in 1 cup boiling water. 
                Set aside until water comes to room temperature.
            </li>
            <li>
                Meanwhile, sift flour, salt, and baking powder into a 
                large mixing bowl. Stir in the vegetable shortening 
                until it is thoroughly combined. (This will have a 
                paste-like consistency.)
            </li>
            <li>
                Stir in the egg yolks, sugar, sesame seeds, 
                and remaining anise seeds. Add the anise tea 
                a little bit at a time. I start out with about 
                1/2 cup. Add more if you feel it needs it. 
                The consistency should be like a soft 
                cookie dough. It shouldn't really stick to 
                your hands, but it should be soft and pliable. 
                Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate 
                for at least 15 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Line two half cookie sheets 
                with parchment paper. Have a loaf pan ready, as well. 
                Use a mini ice cream scoop to scoop out even portions 
                of cookie dough. Roll into little logs that are as long 
                as the width of the loaf pan. Place logs on the cookie 
                sheets about an inch apart. When you fill up a cookie sheet, 
                place in the refrigerator to chill for at least one 
                hour. Repeat with remaining cookie dough until you use 
                it all up. You may end up with more cookies than you need.
            </li>
            <li>
                When the cookie dough is chilled, place one cookie sheet 
                on the middle rack of your preheated oven and bake for 
                about 20 minutes or until golden brown. Remove cookies 
                from oven and place on a cooling rack. Repeat with remaining 
                cookies. Cookies can be stored for a couple of days until 
                ready to assemble the turron.
            </li>
            <li>
                To assemble the turron, line your loaf pan with lightly 
                greased wax paper. Place one layer of cookies closely 
                together in the loaf pan. (Be careful; the cookies are 
                very delicate.) Generously drizzle and gently spread a 
                layer of caramel on top of the cookies (see Note below 
                regarding caramel temperature). Be careful not to spread 
                too forcefully or you will break the cookies. Add another 
                layer of cookies, followed by another generous layer of 
                caramel. Continue layering cookies and caramel until you 
                reach the top of the loaf pan or finish using up the cookies.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add a final layer of caramel and decorate generously with 
                sprinkles. Artfully place some prunes on top, as well. 
                Cover the loaf pan with foil and place somewhere cool to 
                set. When it has set, lift out of the loaf pan using the 
                wax paper and place on a serving tray. You can also cut 
                slices directly from the loaf pan.
            </li>
            <li>
                Caramel Note: Make sure your caramel is at the right 
                temperature. If you made it the day before, it may be 
                too stiff to spread over the cookies. If this is the case, 
                place the container of caramel in a large bowl of hot water 
                and stir. You want it to be loose enough to pour and spread, 
                but not so hot that it is liquid. It should be barely warm 
                to the touch.
