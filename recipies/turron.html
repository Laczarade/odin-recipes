        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The Turron de Dona Pepa is an Afro-Peruvian dessert 
            closely associated with the feast of the Lord of Miracles 
            on October 28. It consists of layers of cookies and a fruit- 
            and spice-flavored caramel, topped with colorful sprinkles 
            and a prune or two. The caramel and cookies can be made 
            several days in advance and assembled later. </p>
