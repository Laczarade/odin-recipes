        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Similar to honeycomb toffee candy, dalgona is basically made by 
            melting sugar and stirring in a little bit of baking soda. 
            The sugar mixture then foams up and turns into something that 
            looks like light caramel-colored whipped cream. This is the part 
            that resembles the whipped coffee.</p>
