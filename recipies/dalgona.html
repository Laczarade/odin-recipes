        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Similar to honeycomb toffee candy, dalgona is basically made by 
            melting sugar and stirring in a little bit of baking soda. 
            The sugar mixture then foams up and turns into something that 
            looks like light caramel-colored whipped cream. This is the part 
            that resembles the whipped coffee.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Sugar - 1.5 tablespoon</li>
            <li>Baking Soda - 1/16 teaspoon</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all the ingredients and tools before starting</li>
            <li>
                Add 1.5 tablespoons of sugar to a metal ladle.
                Hold the ladle over low to medium heat. When the sugar starts
                to melt around the edges, stir with a chopstick
            </li>
            <li>
                Continue to stir constantly, controlling the heat.
                If it starts to smoke, raise the ladle a few inches above the heat,
                and lower it closer once it cools off a little. Repeat 
                as necessary until the sugar completely melts without 
                any lumps, but let it cool off a little before adding 
                the baking soda.
            </li>
            <li>
                Holding the ladle away from the heat, stir in the baking soda.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stir quickly and vigorously (20 to 25 times) until the baking soda is 
                completely dissolved and the frothy mixture turns light caramel-color. 
                While stirring, you can bring the ladle closer to the heat for a short 
                second or two to keep it warm, but don't let it puff up too long. It will 
                burn at the bottom.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pour the mixture onto a non-stick baking sheet, skillet, or parchment paper,
                scraping with a rubber spatula.
            </li>
            <li>
                Let it cool for 15 to 20 seconds. Then, lightly tap it to see if it
                doesn't stick, then press it all the way to the desired thickness. 
                This helps prevent the dalgona from sticking to the press.
            </li>
            <li>
                Immediately, stamp it with a cookie cutter, firmly but not all the way through.
                Promptly remove the cutter.
            </li>
        </ol>
