        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            These fragrant, rose-scented, Persian-style marzipan sweets are 
            part of the Sofre Haft-Sin - the traditional Norouz 
            (Iranian New Year) display. "Tout" is the Farsi word for 
            mulberry, and these sweets are traditionally shaped like 
            mulberries.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Blanched almond flour - 1 cup</li>
            <li>Powdered sugar - 1/2 cup</li>
            <li>Ground cardamom - 1/2 teaspoon</li>
            <li>Rose water - 2 tablespoons</li>
            <li>White sugar - 1/4 cup</li>
            <li>Raw pistachios - 2 tablespoons</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Combine almond flour, powdered sugar, and cardamom 
                in a medium bowl. Drizzle in rose water, 1 tablespoon 
                at a time, and gently knead until a soft dough forms 
                that doesn't stick to your hands. Taste and add more 
                powdered sugar to reach desired sweetness. Adjust rose 
                water if needed.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pinch off about 1/2 teaspoon of dough. Form into a ball 
                and shape like a cone, to resemble a mulberry, or any 
                shape that you like. Roll in white sugar. Repeat with 
                remaining dough.
            </li>
            <li>
                Chop pistachios into slivers, resembling stems. Place a 
                pistachio sliver over each piece of "tout."
            </li>
        </ol>
