        <p>
            These fragrant, rose-scented, Persian-style marzipan sweets are 
            part of the Sofre Haft-Sin - the traditional Norouz 
            (Iranian New Year) display. "Tout" is the Farsi word for 
            mulberry, and these sweets are traditionally shaped like 
            mulberries.
